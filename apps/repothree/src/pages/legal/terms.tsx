                    Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain
                    types of warranties or limitations on applicable statutory
                    rights of a consumer, so some or all of the above exclusions
                    and limitations may not apply to You. But in such a case the
                    exclusions and limitations set forth in this section shall
                    be applied to the greatest extent enforceable under
                    applicable law.
